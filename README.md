                                This is a program to automate data entry:

    #Description
This script was written in motivation of facilitating the creation of mailing lists for outlook. it follows the simple approach of automating the keystroaks that a person would perform manually, so in a sense it is a "dumb" automator.

    #Use:
--> run the executable named "Mail_List_Tool.exe" with the black icon that says 'RA' , click on browse and select the text file with the IDs (similar to the sample attached). Once you click on submit you will have 5 seconds to click on the field to add names. If some problem occurs and you want to stop the program, click on the button 'q' a few times and the program will exit.

--> if you don't trust the executable -understandable-, you can read and run the source code after installing the dependencies.
